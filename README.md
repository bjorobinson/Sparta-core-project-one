#### Sprint One

The User Stories of Sprint One were aimed at producing a Minimum Viable Product, and so covered the core functionality and the project basic requirements. For example:

* As a user, I want to see 5 colour coded nodes at the bottom of the screen.
* As a user, I want immediate feedback that I have hit the right notes at the right point in time.
* As a user, I want there to be a score counter that increases as you hit the right notes

#### Sprint Two

With the MVP created. Sprint Two focused on extra features to enhance the core features. For example:

* As a user, I want to be able to decide when the song starts
* As a user, I want to hear four drum taps counting me in
* As a user, I want the ui to look visually appealing

# The Game

The game is a rhythm game inspired, in both gameplay and style, by Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

## Instructions

Click the Begin Song button to begin the game. Match the coloured notes with their corresponding keys when the notes reach the accept zone, denoted by the gold pickup in the background image. A matched note will score a point, a missed note will lose a point, a note played when one is not due will also lose a point.
